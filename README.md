AWS Services (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, EFS, DynamoDB, EventBridge, SQS/SNS, Step Functions,  AWS CI/CD tools.

As part of my certification in AWS Serverless Services on Udemy, I’ve gained hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying production-grade serverless applications using a variety of AWS tools and cloud-native patterns.

I’ve mastered the fundamentals and advanced concepts of AWS Lambda, including function triggers, context management, VPC access, Layers, and performance optimization. I’ve worked extensively with Amazon API Gateway—covering topics such as staging, authentication, throttling, and structured error handling.

The course deepened my understanding of event-driven architectures by building real-world projects using Amazon SQS, SNS, EventBridge, and Step Functions. I also explored Amazon DynamoDB, including advanced features like global tables for multi-region replication and high availability.

DevOps practices were a key focus, where I implemented CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and GitHub. I also learned how to automate infrastructure using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) and CloudFormation for repeatable, scalable deployments.

Crucially, I adopted observability best practices using AWS X-Ray and Lambda Powertools, ensuring each application was production-ready with proper logging, tracing, and metrics.

The course used Node.js and the AWS SDK for JavaScript, which further strengthened my backend development skills in a serverless environment.

Overall, this certification has equipped me with the practical skills to build resilient, scalable, and efficient cloud-native applications—preparing me for real-world roles as a Cloud Engineer, Serverless Developer, or Solutions Architect.
